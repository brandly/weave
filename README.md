# weave

i wanted to try building something like [browserify](http://browserify.org/)

it definitely has problems, but it handles some basic situations

```shell
$ npm install
$ node index.js example > output/try-it.js
$ open output/index.html
```

the example is p lame, but you can open your console and see some output :100:
