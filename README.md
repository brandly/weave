# weave.js

i wanted to try building something like [browserify](http://browserify.org/)

it definitely has problems, but it handles some basic situations

```shell
$ npm install --global weave.js
$ weave --help
$ weave entry.js > bundle.js
```

### dev

```shell
$ npm install
$ bin/build-example
$ open output/index.html
```

the example is a really basic react app, but it works :100:
